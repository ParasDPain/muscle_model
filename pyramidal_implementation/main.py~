Simulation of C.Elegans muscle cell with three currents
and one calcium pump.

This is still at a very early stage, being optimized on
CamGrid using neuronoptimizer. The model represented
here requires the publically-unavailable nrntools
module from the nrndev library. Please email
author (vellamike@gmail.com) for these libraries.
