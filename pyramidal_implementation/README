Denis Turutin described the simulations he sent us as follows:

1. For spontaneous 50s, It is spontaneous evoked (current clamp) with holding current 0 pA.

2. For CCramp it is, 0 pA for 100ms, -20 pA 5ms, from -20pA to 40 pA linear within 2 s, finally 0 pA for 100ms 

We are using the CCramp data (2) (RATIONALE - it is very difficult to interpret the data obtained under the effect of synaptic input, the current injectino should negate synaptic current influx). 

The experimental data recorded in W05042200_1_1_3_1.txt will be used as a target.

Some Calculations - If Denis' protocol description is correct, total time of execution is 0.1+0.05+2+0.1 = 2.205s. There are 11025 data points in the recording, giving a sampling frequency of 5KHz.

Observations:
1. (initial) Resting potential 30mV

Note: the initial hyperpolarizing step can be used to elicit information about the passive properties of the cell.

Initial simulation:

The initial simulation will be of reduced complexity:

Take the component of the ramp from 10pA to 40pA and approximate to 25pA. As the current ramp is linear, 10pA should occur at (100+5+1000)ms = 1105, i.e data point 1.105*5000=5525.To data point 2.105*1000=10525
