Note: this version of the muscle model reflects an initial attempt to convert the model from:
http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0303264708001408 into NeuroML.

We're in the process of updating this to match the version in:
https://github.com/openworm/muscle_model/tree/master/neuron_implementation

See issue: https://github.com/openworm/OpenWorm/issues/169

To install & run this version, install jNeuroML (as outlined here: https://github.com/NeuroML/jNeuroML/blob/master/README.md)

and run:

    jnml LEMS_Figure2A.xml
    jnml LEMS_Figure2B.xml
