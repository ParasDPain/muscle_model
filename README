This repository contains the following:

1. Simulation of C.Elegans muscle cell electrical properties, based on Boyle & Cohen 2008.
2. Optimization script for model above model, utliising Optimal Neuron package. Optimizing towards sharp electrode data obtained from lab of Michael M Francis.
3. C++ Module for importation of arbitrary Pyramidal model into C++ program such as Palyanov et al SPH solver.

Running model
-------------

To run model install pyramidal and its dependencies as described here: 
http://pyramidal.readthedocs.org/en/latest/install.html

Then execute the command:

	>>>python ./pyramidal_implementation/main.py
