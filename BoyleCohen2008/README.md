Muscle cell code from Boyle and Cohen 2008
------------------------------------------

This software was used in the publication:

_J.H. Boyle, N. Cohen, Caenorhabditis elegans body wall muscles are simple actuators, BioSystems 94 (2008) 170â€“181_

to optmise the parameters of a muscle cell model for C. elegans.

**If you use or alter this code please cite the above publication.**

This will be used by the OpenWorm project to create an [initial model of a muscle cell in NeuroML 2](https://github.com/openworm/muscle_model/tree/master/NeuroML2).

A key matlab script is located at [BoyleCohen2008/MatlabSupport/Main_Version/vclamp.m](https://github.com/openworm/muscle_model/blob/master/BoyleCohen2008/MatlabSupport/Main_Version/vclamp.m) which, when run, should produce the graphs of the paper.
